# Multiple-Dataset GIS Operations / Visualization

## Learning Objectives

- Create multi-layered maps
- Calculate the area of polygons 
- Find spatial intersections

## Functions Learned

- `ggplot()`
- `geom_sf()`
- `st_intersects()`
- `filter()`: picks cases based on their values, from the `dplyr` package.

## Interactive Tutorial

```{block type="rmdinfo"}
This workshop's script can be found [here](https://github.com/spatialanalysis/workshop-scripts/blob/master/gis-visualization/spring-2019/R/gis-learning-2.R).
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Challenge**
```
Do you remember how to read in and project data? Try it out! Also calculate the centroids.


```{r}
library(sf)
ward98 <- st_read("data/ward1998.shp")
ward98 <- st_transform(ward98, 32616)
centroids <- st_centroid(ward98)
```

We are going to start plotting with a new package: `ggplot2`. This is my favorite package for plotting `sf` objects, as there is a special function in the package called `geom_sf` that expressly handles spatial data.

The syntax of a ggplot call is as follows:
![](figs/ggplot-syntax.png)

To plot an `sf` object, use `geom_sf()`.
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = ward98) +
  geom_sf()
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Challenge**
```
Use `geom_sf` to make a ggplot of the centroids data.


```{r}
ggplot(data = centroids) +
  geom_sf()
```

```{block type="rmdwarning"}
Note: If you keep getting the following error message, try reversing the `geom_sf`s again and/or highlighting/re-running the lines of code multiple times.

> Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  : 
  polygon edge not found
```

One nice thing about ggplot is that it's super easy to layer things. For example, if I want to plot the wards and the centroids, I can do that by moving the `data =` argument to within the `geom_sf()` call.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ward98) +
  geom_sf(data = centroids)
```

I can also change colors and other settings.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ward98, fill = "lightblue") +
  geom_sf(data = centroids, color = "blue")
```

So far, we've plotted data that was from the same original dataset. What if we want to add a layer with Chicago's waterways?

First we download, import, and project data from the Chicago Data Portal. As an exercise, I'm going to download a [Chicago waterways data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Waterways/eg9f-z3t6) GeoJSON, which `st_read` can also interpret and convert into an `sf` object.

![](figs/waterways-data.png)

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Challenge**
```
Read and project the waterways JSON. Hint: save your JSON file in the data/ folder in your workspace.

```{r}
water <- st_read("data/Waterways.geojson")
water <- st_transform(water, 32616)
```

Now, plot it to see if things are looking alright.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = water)
```

Uh oh, looks like we have Lake Michigan with everything else. We want to filter out that feature. We'll use the `filter()` command from `dplyr`.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
water_clean <- filter(water, name != "LAKE MICHIGAN")
```

Now we can make a map with both the wards and the waterways in Chicago.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ward98) +
  geom_sf(data = water_clean, color = "blue")
```

```{block type="rmdwarning"}
Note that order matters here! ggplot plots in the order that you give your functions to it, so if you reorder the `geom_sf` calls, the wards are mapped after - and on top of! - the rivers.
```

```{r}
# Incorrect order of geom_sf() calls
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = water_clean, color = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = ward98)
```

The last thing we'll do is figure out which wards intersect with waterways, using a powerful `sf` function called `st_intersects`. The output of `st_intersects` is a bit strange: it's a list of indexes of the intersected features for each ward. 

The main thing you need to know is: if there is nothing in the list for a feature, that means nothing intersects with it.
```{r}
intersects <- st_intersects(ward98, water_clean)
str(intersects)
```

```{block type="rmdwarning"}

Note: This is where projection is extremely important. If you get an error message that says:

> Error: st_crs(x) == st_crs(y) is not TRUE

that probably means that you forgot to project one of your datasets. Check the CRS with both and fix it with `st_transform`.
```

This is a little hairy, so in order to use this reasonably, we combine it with the `filter` command we learned earlier. We are filtering the original data by whether or not it has any water features that intersect with it.

```{r}
water_wards <- filter(ward98, lengths(intersects) > 0)
```

```{block type="rmdwarning"}
Note: Don't forget the `s` in `lengths` like I did during the workshop!
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
Can you plot the wards, the rivers, and the wards that intersect with a river?
```{block type="learncheck"}
```

The grand finale!
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ward98) +
  geom_sf(data = water_wards, fill = "lightblue") +
  geom_sf(data = water_clean, color = "blue")
```

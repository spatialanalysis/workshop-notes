# Custom and Animated Maps

## Learning Objectives

- Use `urban_agglomerations` and `world` data from the `spData` package
- Make the same map in `ggplot2` and `tmap`
- Make an animated map and save it 

## Functions Learned

- `tm_shape`
- `tm_polygons`
- `tm_dots`
- `tm_facets`
- `tmap_animation`

## Challenges

This workshop uses an [example]() from Geocomputation with R, developed by Robin Lovelace. The original script can be found [online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/master/code/08-urban-animation.R).

```{block type="rmdwarning"}
If you get the following error, make sure the `magick` package is installed with `install.packages("magick")`, and that ImageMagick itself is installed:

>Error in tmap::tmap_animation(tm, filename = "doc/city-pop.gif") : 
>  Could not find ImageMagick. Make sure it is installed and included in the systems PATH
```


```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
1. Look at the `urban_agglomerations` and the `world` data. What type of spatial data is each (point, line, polygon)? How many observations are in each dataset?

2. What projection is each in?

3. Make a ggplot2 map of both datasets

3. Make a tmap map of `urban_agglomerations`.

4. Change the color of the points to one of your choosing.

Luc Anselin has written a more in-depth tutorial for tmap, which you can find and go through [here](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials/), under Introduction to Spatial Data Science > Basic Mapping.

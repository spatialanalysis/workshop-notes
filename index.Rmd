# Introduction {-}

This site contains workshop notes from the R Spatial Workshop at the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/). Workshops are held on **Wednesdays at 10am and 2pm** during Spring Quarter 2019. Our goal for running these workshops are to teach researchers how to work effectively with spatial data in R. 

You are welcome to join us in **Searle 240B** for workshops if you're a member of the UChicago campus community! Bring a laptop to follow along.

## Workshop Organization {-}

Each chapter of this [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) book represents a 1-hour workshop taught at the center. Chapters will be uploaded after the workshop so you can self study the material.

A tentative **workshop schedule** can be found at [this link](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/events/workshop-schedules/).

**Scripts** from the workshops will be uploaded to Github following each workshop and can be found at [this link](https://github.com/spatialanalysis/workshop-scripts).

**Data** used in the workshops will be linked to in each workshop chapter or can be found on the GeoDa Center [data website](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/). All data will eventually be found in an R package developed by the CSDS.

## Prior Knowledge {-}

We assume that workshop attendees have used RStudio and are familiar with the basics of R. 

If you need a refresher, this [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) tutorial developed by Data Carpentry is a good place to start. Additionally, Luc Anselin's introductory R lab notes can be found on the [CSDS Tutorials page](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials).

## Topics {-}

We plan to cover the following topics:

- Spatial data formats
- Projections
- Spatial data handling
- Spatial data operations
- Static maps
- Interactive maps
- Organization of research projects
- Reproducible research with R

## Additional information {-}

Workshops are run by Angela Li, R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS. If you have any questions about the following material, please reach out to her at ali6@uchicago.edu.

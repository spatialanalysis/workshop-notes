# R Markdown and Custom Maps

## Learning Objectives

- Create a R Markdown document
- Embed code and text in an R Markdown document
- Manipulate R Markdown chunk options
- Become familiar with the `tmap` package

## Topics Learned

- .rmd structure
- Code chunks in R Markdown

```{block type="rmdinfo"}
Hint: Use the R Markdown guides in RStudio under Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheatsheet (or R Markdown Reference Guide) for help.
```

## Interactive Tutorial

```{block type="rmdinfo"}
This workshop's R Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/spatialanalysis/workshop-scripts/blob/master/gis-visualization/winter-2019/doc/05-rmarkdown.Rmd).
```

## Challenges

We're going to continue using the data we used last week from the Chicago Data Portal, but we'll be working in a R Markdown document instead of a R script.

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
1. Create a new R Markdown document. Knit the document. 

2. Change the YAML header at the top to include your personal information. Try changing some of the options in the header (aka the options between the "---"):

- `output: pdf_document`
- `fontsize: 14pt`

You can use this [reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) to help you out.

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
3. Use Markdown formatting to write some information about the Chicago libraries and community areas datasets. Use:

- sections
- bold/italic text
- two types of lists

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
4. Insert an `ggplot2` image that we created last time in the document.

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

Here's the data from last week:

- [Libraries](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Libraries-Locations-Hours-and-Contact-Information/x8fc-8rcq) points
- [Community Area](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6) polygons

Remember: you can click on the "API" button to directly access the data, rather than having to download a csv via "Export".

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
5. Add code chunks that:

- load packages 
- read data 
- create a ggplot2 plot 

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
6. Add chunk options that:

- load packages (hide this code)
- read data (show this code, and run it)
- create a ggplot2 plot (don't show this code, but run it, and control the size of the figure)

7. Try naming your chunks something useful.

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Challenge**
```
8. Try making a map with `tmap` (similar syntax as `ggplot2`), using the [`tmap` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html).

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

```{block type="rmdinfo"}
Luc Anselin has written a more in-depth tutorial for tmap, which you can find and go through [here](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials/), under Introduction to Spatial Data Science > Basic Mapping.

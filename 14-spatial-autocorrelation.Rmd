# Spatial Autocorrelation

## Install packages

Make sure you have the **spdep** package installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spdep")
```

I also developed a helper package for some of this spatial autocorrelation stuff, called [**sfExtras**](https://github.com/spatialanalysis/sfExtras). Install with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("spatialanalysis/sfExtras")
```

## Review from previous workshops

We'll be working with a new dataset, called "ncovr". Go ahead and load it with geodaData:

```{r}
library(geodaData)
library(sf)
head(ncovr)
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Question**
```
Take a few minutes and try to understand what this is about. 

- How many observations and variables are there? What data is stored? (`dim()`, `str()`, `head()`, `summary()`) 
- What does the metadata tell you about this data? (`?ncovr`)
- What geometries are in this data? Can you make a quick map with `plot()`?
- What coordinate reference system is there? Is this data projected? (`st_crs()`) 

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

```{block type="learncheck"}
**Question**
```
Try to make a simple map of one of the attributes of interest (homicides, etc) with tmap. Can you make it interactive?

```{block type="learncheck"}
```

## Spatial autocorrelation

We'll start by talking about spatial weights. There are two main types of spatial weights, contiguity and distance based weights.

We'll focus on contiguity today: aka, that a spatial unit shares a border with another spatial unit. We look at **rook** vs. **queen** contiguity.

There's also second order contiguity:

How we define "neighbors" matters when we are trying to determine spatial autocorrelation.

## Code time

Load two more libraries:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sfExtras)
library(spdep)
```

We'll be using the following functions (potentially buggy):

```{r eval=FALSE}
?st_rook
?st_queen
?st_as_nb
?st_centroid_coords # for mapping the weights
```

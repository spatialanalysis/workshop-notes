Workshops are held on Tuesdays at noon during Winter Quarter 2019. Our goal for running these workshops are to teach researchers how to work effectively with spatial data in R. You are welcome to join us in Searle 240B for workshops if you’re a member of the UChicago campus community! Bring a laptop to follow along. Additionally, please fill out the following short survey if you plan to attend the workshop this quarter. Workshop Organization Each chapter of this bookdown book represents a 1-hour workshop taught at the center. Chapters will be uploaded after the workshop so you can self study the material. A tentative workshop schedule can be found at this link. Scripts from the workshops will be uploaded to Github following each workshop and can be found in the R folder at this link. Data used in the workshops can be found on the GeoDa Center data website, or will be linked to in each workshop chapter. All data will eventually be found in an R package developed by the CSDS. Prior Knowledge We assume that workshop attendees have used RStudio and are familiar with the basics of R. If you need a refresher, this R for Social Scientists tutorial developed by Data Carpentry is a good place to start. Additionally, Luc Anselin’s introductory R lab notes can be found on the CSDS Tutorials page. Topics We plan to cover the following topics: Spatial data formats Projections Spatial data handling Spatial data operations Static maps Interactive maps Organization of research projects Reproducible research with R Additional information Workshops are run by Angela Li, R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS.

["introduction-to-spatial-data.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to Spatial Data 1.1 Learning Objectives 1.2 Spatial Data Basics 1.3 Interactive Tutorial 1.4 Links", " Chapter 1 Introduction to Spatial Data 1.1 Learning Objectives Understand the difference between vector and raster data Describe the components of a PROJ4 string Name the two main packages for spatial vector data in R Import, project, and plot spatial data in R 1.2 Spatial Data Basics We first reviewed some important information about spatial data. The two main types are vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster (pixels, surfaces). Since this workshop is given in the context of social science research, the rest of our workshop focuses on vector data such as administrative boundaries, locations of business, or road networks. Next, we went over what a coordinate reference system was, as well as the components of a PROJ4 string, or how coordinate reference systems are stored electronically. Rather than writing out the whole PROJ4 string, we can use an EPSG code as shorthand for it. This Software Carpentry workshop provides excellent explanations and exercises for understanding coordinate reference systems. Finally, we learned that sf is the modern package for handling spatial data in R. Some old packages still use sp. However, it has a much more complicated representation of spatial data, so we will focus on sf. See this guide for a translation of sp to sf commands, if you’re used to using sp. 1.3 Interactive Tutorial The rest of the workshop was dedicated to a hands-on exercise where we live coded together. The data we used was 1986 Chicago aldermanic ward boundary data, which can be found on the UChicago Map Collection page here. This workshop’s script can be found here. 1.3.1 Functions learned st_read() st_crs() st_transform() 1.3.2 Import spatial data The first thing we’ll do is import the spatial data. Our spatial data happens to be stored as a shapefile (.shp, but actually 4 files). These are getting less fashionable (see GeoJSON, etc.), but a lot of spatial data is still stored this way. First load the sf library. If you don’t have it, install it in your console or in the Packages RStudio pane. # install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) library(sf) ## Warning: package &#39;sf&#39; was built under R version 3.4.4 ## Linking to GEOS 3.6.1, GDAL 2.1.3, PROJ 4.9.3 We’ll use the st_read function. This also reads GeoJSON, PostGIS databases, and more. ward86 &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/ward1986.shp&quot;) ## Reading layer `ward1986&#39; from data source `/Users/angela/Desktop/Spatial Data Science/workshop-notes/data/ward1986.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 51 features and 1 field (with 1 geometry empty) ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -87.9402 ymin: 41.6443 xmax: -87.524 ymax: 42.0231 ## epsg (SRID): 4269 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=NAD83 +no_defs You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Enter to run a line of code in R. Press tab after typing in st_read(“”) with your cursor in between the quotation marks and you’ll get a nice autocomplete feature. Check what projection the data is in: st_crs(ward86) ## Coordinate Reference System: ## EPSG: 4269 ## proj4string: &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=NAD83 +no_defs&quot; Sike, this isn’t projected! You can tell because the proj4string starts with +proj=longlat. You can still plot this, but things will start to get iffy if you try to do distance or area calculations, or plot these ward boundaries with other layers. I can still plot the map, but as a good geographic data analyst, I’ll need to project it. plot(ward86) 1.3.3 Project your data We need to project the data: but how do we choose what projection we need? This is a deep philosophical question, but thankfully the UChicago library has already told us the best projections to use for our data: Illinois East State Plane or UTM Zone 16. I generally do a online search to look up the EPSG codes for the projection I want to use, or use spatialreference.org, which has a database for all EPSG codes for projections. After I do some sleuthing, I find that the EPSG code I want for UTM Zone 16 is 32616. I then use st_transform() to project the data, and save it as a new sf dataframe. ward86_utm &lt;- st_transform(ward86, 32616) I check the CRS - yep, looks right! st_crs(ward86_utm) ## Coordinate Reference System: ## EPSG: 32616 ## proj4string: &quot;+proj=utm +zone=16 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs&quot; Challenge Question: what datum is this in? What are the units for this projection? Plot it: plot(ward86_utm) Challenge Project the 1986 ward data into the Illinois East State plane projection. Follow the above steps to do so. Hint: look up the EPSG code online! ward86_stateplane &lt;- st_transform(ward86, 3435) st_crs(ward86_stateplane) ## Coordinate Reference System: ## EPSG: 3435 ## proj4string: &quot;+proj=tmerc +lat_0=36.66666666666666 +lon_0=-88.33333333333333 +k=0.9999749999999999 +x_0=300000.0000000001 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs&quot; plot(ward86_stateplane) Note that the +units=us-ft part of the proj4string means that any distance calculations you do on the ward86_stateplane data will be done in feet. Keep in mind that there are “bad” projections for your data. For example, if I accidentally chose the Alaska Albers projection for my data… ward86_alaska &lt;- st_transform(ward86, 3338) plot(ward86_alaska) Clearly this projection isn’t great for Chicago! But something to keep in mind, if, say, you’re making maps of places closer to the poles. ``` 1.4 Links All the links in this workshop: Software Carpentry Vector Data tutorial: https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/02-intro-vector-data/index.html Software Carpentry CRS tutorial: https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs/index.html sf reference site: https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html Migrating from sp to sf guide: https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/wiki/Migrating GeoJSON explanation: http://geojson.org/ Chicago ward data: https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/collections/maps/chigis.html Link to good EPSG lookup website: http://spatialreference.org/ "],

Challenge Do you remember how to read in and project data? Try it out! Also calculate the centroids. library(sf) ward98 &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/ward1998.shp&quot;) ## Reading layer `ward1998&#39; from data source `/Users/angela/Desktop/Spatial Data Science/workshop-notes/data/ward1998.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 50 features and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -87.94021 ymin: 41.64434 xmax: -87.52404 ymax: 42.02313 ## epsg (SRID): 4269 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=NAD83 +no_defs ward98 &lt;- st_transform(ward98, 32616) centroids &lt;- st_centroid(ward98) ## Warning in st_centroid.sf(ward98): st_centroid assumes attributes are ## constant over geometries of x We are going to start plotting with a new package: ggplot2. This is my favorite package for plotting sf objects, as there is a special function in the package called geom_sf that expressly handles spatial data. The syntax of a ggplot call is as follows: To plot an sf object, use geom_sf(). library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = ward98) + geom_sf() Challenge Use geom_sf to make a ggplot of the centroids data. ggplot(data = centroids) + geom_sf() Note: If you keep getting the following error message, try reversing the geom_sfs again and/or highlighting/re-running the lines of code multiple times. Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x\\(label), x\\)x, x$y, : polygon edge not found One nice thing about ggplot is that it’s super easy to layer things. For example, if I want to plot the wards and the centroids, I can do that by moving the data = argument to within the geom_sf() call. ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ward98) + geom_sf(data = centroids) I can also change colors and other settings. ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ward98, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + geom_sf(data = centroids, color = &quot;blue&quot;) So far, we’ve plotted data that was from the same original dataset. What if we want to add a layer with Chicago’s waterways? First we download, import, and project data from the Chicago Data Portal. As an exercise, I’m going to download a Chicago waterways data GeoJSON, which st_read can also interpret and convert into an sf object. Challenge Read and project the waterways JSON. Hint: save your JSON file in the data/ folder in your workspace. water &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/Waterways.geojson&quot;) ## Reading layer `OGRGeoJSON&#39; from data source `/Users/angela/Desktop/Spatial Data Science/workshop-notes/data/Waterways.geojson&#39; using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 605 features and 6 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -87.9389 ymin: 41.6195 xmax: -86.20666 ymax: 43.21631 ## epsg (SRID): 4326 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs water &lt;- st_transform(water, 32616) Now, plot it to see if things are looking alright. ggplot() + geom_sf(data = water) Uh oh, looks like we have Lake Michigan with everything else. We want to filter out that feature. We’ll use the filter() command from dplyr. library(dplyr) water_clean &lt;- filter(water, name != &quot;LAKE MICHIGAN&quot;) Now we can make a map with both the wards and the waterways in Chicago. ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ward98) + geom_sf(data = water_clean, color = &quot;blue&quot;) Note that order matters here! ggplot plots in the order that you give your functions to it, so if you reorder the geom_sf calls, the wards are mapped after - and on top of! - the rivers. # Incorrect order of geom_sf() calls ggplot() + geom_sf(data = water_clean, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_sf(data = ward98) The last thing we’ll do is figure out which wards intersect with waterways, using a powerful sf function called st_intersects. The output of st_intersects is a bit strange: it’s a list of indexes of the intersected features for each ward. The main thing you need to know is: if there is nothing in the list for a feature, that means nothing intersects with it. intersects &lt;- st_intersects(ward98, water_clean) str(intersects) ## List of 50 ## $ : int [1:146] 21 28 38 39 46 47 59 67 68 71 ... ## $ : int [1:28] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ... ## $ : int [1:24] 1 2 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 23 ... ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:3] 186 187 189 ## $ : int [1:3] 45 62 63 ## $ : int [1:3] 192 194 195 ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:6] 381 389 390 569 579 586 ## $ : int [1:6] 64 65 66 143 155 156 ## $ : int 224 ## $ : int [1:14] 37 40 43 44 49 50 51 53 54 55 ... ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int 382 ## $ : int [1:34] 2 3 15 16 17 18 19 20 303 569 ... ## $ : int [1:13] 30 314 315 316 328 329 458 463 464 466 ... ## $ : int [1:23] 154 228 297 310 311 321 323 325 327 330 ... ## $ : int [1:6] 370 581 582 583 584 585 ## $ : int [1:3] 380 384 386 ## $ : int 58 ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:21] 291 292 293 294 295 296 307 308 309 311 ... ## $ : int [1:18] 383 400 401 402 411 413 420 422 428 429 ... ## $ : int [1:3] 509 510 511 ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:16] 264 446 447 452 454 455 460 462 465 478 ... ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int 449 ## $ : int [1:34] 168 191 250 255 256 257 267 268 274 275 ... ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:15] 227 247 250 253 258 265 275 280 284 290 ... ## $ : int [1:67] 29 60 61 79 152 153 162 178 193 213 ... ## $ : int [1:59] 70 99 154 228 297 310 331 332 333 334 ... ## $ : int [1:17] 48 241 248 298 299 300 301 302 305 306 ... ## $ : int 469 ## $ : int [1:15] 153 200 251 252 254 260 262 263 266 270 ... ## $ : int [1:2] 425 438 ## $ : int [1:8] 432 433 439 440 453 456 458 459 ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:32] 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 157 158 ... ## $ : int [1:4] 205 221 227 526 ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:32] 69 73 87 105 119 121 126 133 135 138 ... ## $ : int [1:7] 80 84 89 229 230 232 236 ## $ : int(0) ## $ : int [1:2] 190 223 ## - attr(*, &quot;predicate&quot;)= chr &quot;intersects&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;region.id&quot;)= chr [1:50] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;ncol&quot;)= int 604 ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;sgbp&quot; Note: This is where projection is extremely important. If you get an error message that says: Error: st_crs(x) == st_crs(y) is not TRUE that probably means that you forgot to project one of your datasets. Check the CRS with both and fix it with st_transform. This is a little hairy, so in order to use this reasonably, we combine it with the filter command we learned earlier. We are filtering the original data by whether or not it has any water features that intersect with it. water_wards &lt;- filter(ward98, lengths(intersects) &gt; 0) Note: Don’t forget the s in lengths like I did during the workshop! Challenge Can you plot the wards, the rivers, and the wards that intersect with a river? The grand finale! ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ward98) + geom_sf(data = water_wards, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + geom_sf(data = water_clean, color = &quot;blue&quot;) Remember to push your work to Github to back it up! 3.4 Links Link to current Chicago waterways data: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Waterways/eg9f-z3t6 geom_sf documentation page: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html ggsave documentation page: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html dplyr package documentation site: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org Excellent blog post on how to manipulate spatial information: http://strimas.com/r/tidy-sf/ "],

Save as a variable called &quot;no_lib&quot; Hint: use &quot;==&quot; instead of &quot;&gt;&quot; in the logical comparison # Make a ggplot with libraries, community areas, and community areas without libraries The order in which you give arguments to st_intersects matters! I always have to look it up, but for point-in-polygon, you want the polygon first, then the points. One question you may be asking yourself is, how many libraries are in each area? We can tackle this with an operation known as a spatial join. What we do is join information about the polygons to the points, so we have for each point which community area it’s in. More formally, we are adding the attributes of a layer to the other one. A spatial join is not the same as an attribute join, which is based on common column (attribute) values between two datasets. Spatial joins are based on a spatial relationship: is this point inside this polygon? The syntax is generally as follows, for point-in-polygon: st_join(point_sf, poly_sf) 4.4.1 A simple example We can spatial join just one attribute, or a few. We can use select() to choose attributes. One we’ve done our spatial join, we can manipulate the data with count() and arrange() to figure out which community areas have the most libraries. This is also known as spatial aggregation. If work with the spatial data gets too clumsy or slow, we can drop the geometry column with st_geometry()&lt;-. 4.4.2 Saving your plots We ran out of time for this last time, but to save a ggplot image, you can use ggsave() after a ggplot2 command. You can adjust the width and height of the image in arguments to the function.

If you get the following error, make sure the magick package is installed with install.packages(“magick”), and that ImageMagick itself is installed: Error in tmap::tmap_animation(tm, filename = “doc/city-pop.gif”) : Could not find ImageMagick. Make sure it is installed and included in the systems PATH Challenge Look at the urban_agglomerations and the world data. What type of spatial data is each (point, line, polygon)? How many observations are in each dataset? What projection is each in? Make a ggplot2 map of both datasets Challenge Make a tmap map of urban_agglomerations. Challenge Change the color of the points to one of your choosing. Luc Anselin has written a more in-depth tutorial for tmap, which you can find and go through here, under Introduction to Spatial Data Science &gt; Basic Mapping. 6.5 Links The links in this workshop: Geocomputation with R - Chapter 8 talks about making maps with tmap: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html Getting started with tmap vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html "],
